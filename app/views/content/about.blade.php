<h2 class="page-header">About RadioSNHU</h2>
<p>RadioSNHU has come a long ways since its humble beginnings in 1999.</p>
<p>The station started off as RadioNHC during the final years of New Hampshire College. RadioNHC was started as a club at NHC in the Spring of 1999. After a lot of hard work and time, RadioNHC had its inaugural broadcast on March 31, 2000 out of Chicorura. As the second college radio station in the United States to broadcast exclusively online, RadioNHC could be called an pioneer for college stations around the country.</p>
<p>With the collegeâ€™s name change to Southern New Hampshire University in July 2001, the radio station also needed a new name. Radioactive 1620 AM was relaunched in September 2001, now broadcasting locally on 1620 AM along with a revamped online broadcast. Since we found online streaming companies to be unreliable, the station took its online broadcasting in-house, vastly increasing the reliabilty of the online broadcast.</p>
<p>Since then, the station has never stopped growing. 1620 Sports was introduced in the winter of 2001-2002, bringing first tape delayed then live broadcasts of basketball, hockey, and even soccer at times. We also worked on expanding programming. We gained listeners from across the United States and the world, thanks to our ties with many of our international students.</p>
<p>After the Spring 2004 semester that saw the graduation of several longtime members of the station, the station was renamed RadioSNHU to leverage our ties with the university. During the summer of 2004, our broadcast studios in Stark Hall Rooms 1 and 1A were completely renovated, giving us our truly first modern and usable studio.
We hope you enjoyed what the station has accomplished over the past few years and hope you continue to listen to your source of music, news, and sports at SNHU.</p>
